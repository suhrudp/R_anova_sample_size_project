# R_anova_sample_size_project

A project that I worked on for a client to calculate power to run a one-way analysis of variance with 3 levels using the `pwr2ppl` package in R, and plan for statistical data analysis.

The study aimed to assess which orthopedic technique (Ranawatâ€™s technique, Amstutz technique, and the double stitch technique) has the best outcomes to minimize limb length discrepancy in patients undergoing unilateral limb length arthroplasty.
